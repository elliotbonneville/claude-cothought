# Metamap Research

The metamap is a living self-model that sits on top of daily journal entries. It draws on research from seven domains: therapeutic case formulation, metacognition, personal knowledge management, quantified self, narrative identity, AI-assisted journaling, and graph-based personal tracking.

This document collects the research foundations and explains why each section of the metamap exists.

## 1. Therapeutic Case Formulation

How therapists track a patient across sessions — not just what happened, but the underlying model of the person.

- **CBT case conceptualization** — core beliefs, automatic thoughts, behavioral patterns, triggers, compensatory strategies. A living document updated as therapy progresses. The structure: "when X happens, you think Y, which makes you feel Z, which makes you do W."
- **Psychodynamic formulation** — deeper layer. Defense mechanisms, attachment patterns, recurring relational dynamics. Less about behavior, more about *why* the behavior exists.
- **Narrative therapy re-authoring maps (Michael White)** — people get stuck in "dominant stories" about themselves ("I never finish anything") and therapy helps them find "unique outcomes" — moments that contradict the dominant story.
- **IFS (Internal Family Systems) parts mapping** — the idea that you have internal "parts" (the maximizer, the scared part, the builder) that have different needs and sometimes conflict. Tracking which parts show up in which contexts.

**What the metamap takes:** The CBT formulation structure (triggers, beliefs, feelings, behaviors) applied to journal patterns. Narrative therapy's dual tracking of dominant stories vs. contradicting evidence. Optional IFS parts tracking.

## 2. Metacognition & Reflective Practice

What makes reflection actually change behavior vs. just feel good?

- **Schön's reflective practice** — distinguishes "reflection-in-action" (adjusting while doing) from "reflection-on-action" (looking back afterward). The metamap captures reflection-on-action; the journal captures reflection-in-action.
- **Gibbs' reflective cycle** — Description → Feelings → Evaluation → Analysis → Conclusion → Action Plan. Most journaling stays in Description and Feelings. The metamap pushes into Analysis and Action Plan.
- **Kolb's experiential learning** — Experience → Reflect → Conceptualize → Experiment. The key: reflection without experimentation is just rumination.
- **Di Stefano et al. (2014, Harvard Business School)** — Structured reflection outperforms free-form journaling for behavior change. Prompts that ask "what would I do differently?" produce more change than prompts that ask "how did I feel?"

**What the metamap takes:** Track whether insights led to experiments, and whether experiments led to change. The Breakthroughs & Experiments section: "Realized X → Tried Y → Result: Z."

## 3. Personal Knowledge Management

How people track evolving ideas about themselves over time.

- **Zettelkasten (Luhmann)** — atomic notes, linked by association. The metamap is a special "hub note" that links to everything else.
- **Evergreen notes (Andy Matuschak)** — notes that evolve over time, written as claims ("Calm authority is more effective than threats") rather than topics ("Parenting"). Claims can be tested, refined, or retired.
- **Progressive summarization (Tiago Forte)** — each layer distills the one below it. Journal entries → session reflections → metamap → seasonal snapshots. The metamap is the highest-fidelity compression of the raw journal.

**What the metamap takes:** Evergreen claims as the format for entries. Progressive summarization as the compression model.

## 4. Quantified Self & Life Tracking

What's actually useful to track about mental/emotional state?

- **Mood tracking** — simple 1-10 scales are surprisingly useful when correlated with behaviors (sleep, exercise, supplements). Consistency matters more than granularity.
- **Habit tracking** — research supports tracking completion of small habits more than tracking outcomes.
- **Pennebaker's expressive writing research** — journaling improves health outcomes ONLY when people move from describing events to making meaning. Pure venting doesn't help. The metamap IS the meaning-making layer.
- **Context markers** — the most useful data for journaling isn't mood scores, it's context: sleep quality, supplements taken, time of day, who was around. These predict emotional state better than any self-rating.

**What the metamap takes:** Physical State Correlations section. Body → mind connections confirmed across multiple sessions. Lightweight, observation-based.

## 5. Narrative Identity

Dan McAdams' research: we construct our identity through the stories we tell about ourselves.

- **Redemption sequences** — "I was struggling, but then I grew." People who frame difficult experiences as redemption sequences have better mental health outcomes than those who use contamination sequences ("things were good, then they fell apart").
- **Life chapters** — McAdams asks people to divide their life into chapters and title them. The act of titling reveals how you're framing that period.
- **Agency and communion** — the two master themes in life narratives. Agency = "I made things happen." Communion = "I connected with others." Healthy narratives balance both.
- **Narrative identity is not fixed** — the story you tell about yourself *right now* shapes what you do next. If the metamap holds a narrative ("I'm someone who leaves when things get hard"), surfacing it explicitly creates the chance to rewrite it.

**What the metamap takes:** The "chapter title" in the Who I Am Right Now section. The Dominant Stories & Counter-Evidence table — the most important section. Tracking which framing (redemption vs. contamination) the user is using.

## 6. AI-Assisted Journaling

What's been tried in the AI + journaling space?

- **Reflective AI companions** — most AI journaling tools are prompt-based ("How are you feeling today?") rather than longitudinal. They don't carry context across sessions. The metamap solves this.
- **CBT chatbots (Woebot, Wysa)** — research shows they reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in mild-moderate cases. The mechanism: structured reflection + pattern recognition. Limitation: they don't know you.
- **The opportunity** — a metamap turns a generic AI journaling session into something that *knows your patterns*, *remembers your commitments*, and *challenges your dominant stories with your own evidence*. It carries the therapeutic relationship forward.

## 7. Graph-Based Personal Tracking

- **Concept mapping (Novak)** — forcing articulation of relationships between ideas improves understanding. "Magnesium → regulation → calm parenting → morning structure" is more useful than tracking each independently.
- **Knowledge graphs** — the value is in seeing unexpected connections. Explicit relationships between concepts ("X connects to Y because Z") rather than just a list.

**What the metamap takes:** Explicit connections between threads, patterns, and correlations. The Active Threads table has a "Connected To" column for this reason.

## What makes the metamap different from a summary

A summary looks backward. The metamap looks *around*. It's not "what happened this week" — it's "what's true about me right now, and how do I know?"

The most powerful feature: **dominant stories vs. counter-evidence**. Most people walk around believing things about themselves that their own journal contradicts. The metamap makes that visible.
